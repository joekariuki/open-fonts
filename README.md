# Open Fonts
This repository contains a collection of links to free and open source fonts and how the fonts have been implemented on across the web. The repository was created to inspire designers and developers on how they can implement various free or open source fonts on their projects.

## Why?
I created this project because I wanted to have a way I could easily look up how a particular font has been implemented and be able to make a quick decision as to whether it would be a good fit for a project I am working on.

I hope this resource helps you with your projects
